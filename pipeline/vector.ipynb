Duran, et al. (Duran, et al.) separately assail and seek to nullify the Decision\\n[2]\\nof the Court of Appeals (CA) dated September 19, 2003 in CA-G.R. SP No. 65822 that set aside the February 7, 2001 Decision of the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB) in DARAB Case No. 4176. Likewise sought to be annulled is the Resolution of the CA dated January 22, 2004\\n[3]\\nthat denied separate motions for reconsideration of the September 19, 2003 Decision. The reversed DARAB decision upheld the agrarian reform coverage of 1,266 hectares of respondent estate's 1,644.55-hectare property and its award to over a thousand farmer-beneficiaries. The CA's reversing decision, on the other hand, is hinged on the illegality of the coverage and the consequent award. According to the CA, the property in question, having meanwhile ceased to be agricultural, is not amenable to land reform coverage and, hence, falls outside of DAR's jurisdiction to implement agrarian enactments. In G.R. No. 161796, petitioner Land Bank faults the CA insofar as it accorded retroactive exclusionary application to Presidential Proclamation No. (Proclamation) 1283,\\n[4]\\nas amended by Proclamation 1637. [5]\\nIn so doing, so Land Bank claims, the appellate court effectively but illegally extended exempt-coverage status to the subject land and in the process negated\\xa0 the purpose behind Presidential Decree No. (PD) 27: to emancipate rice/corn land tenant-farmers from the bondage of the soil under their tillage. Pursuing cognate arguments, petitioner DAR, in G.R. No. 161830, assails the CA's holding, and the premises tying it together, on the department's jurisdiction over the property subject of the case. In G.R. No. 190456, petitioners Duran, et al. take issue at the CA's pronouncement on the validity of service of the petition for review effected by respondent upon their long-deceased counsel of record, Atty. Eduardo Soliven Lara (Atty. Lara).

No. 161796', 'DECISION', 1, 'Lara). [6]\\nLike Land Bank and DAR, Duran, et al. impute reversible error on the CA for holding that the concerned farmer-beneficiaries never acquired ownership over their respective portions subject of the DAR award, owing to the prior conversion of the whole property to non-agricultural uses before the completion of the land reform process. Per its Resolution of June 28, 2004, the Court ordered the consolidation of G.R. Nos. 161796 and 161830 with G.R. No. 163174 (\\nNell-Armin Raralio v. Estate of J. Amado Araneta\\n). Another Resolution issued on November 17, 2010 directed that G.R. No. 190456 be consolidated with G.R. Nos. 161796, 161830 and 163174. Due, however, to the denial, per Resolution of August 18, 2004, of the petition in G.R. No. 163174 and pursuant to entry of judgment dated December 9, 2004, the Court, by Resolution dated July 11, 2011, deconsolidated G.R.

The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), in particular, was directed to initiate condemnation proceedings for the acquisition of private lands within the new townsite, among which was Lot 23 (the Doronilla property). Prior to the issuance of the LS Townsite proclamations, the following events transpired:\\n(1) On October 21, 1972, PD 27 (\\nTenant\\'s Emancipation Decree\\n) was issued. In accordance with PD 27 in relation to LOI 474 and related issuances, the DAR undertook to place under the\\nOperation Land Transfer\\n(OLT) program of the government all tenanted rice/corn lands with areas of seven hectares or less belonging to landowners who own other agricultural lands of more than seven (7) hectares. In line with this program, the tenants of Doronilla tilling portions of his property, who claimed their primary crops to be rice and/or corn, organized themselves into farmers\\' cooperatives or\\nSamahang Nayon\\ns and applied for certificates of land transfer (CLTs); and\\n(2) The DAR, to which the processed applications were forwarded, processed\\n106 CLTs\\ninvolving\\n100 tenants-beneficiaries\\ncovering\\n73 hectares\\nout of the total 1,645 hectares of Lot 23.

Upon the issuance of Proclamation 1637 on April 18, 1977, on-going parcellary mapping, survey and other processing activities related to the Doronilla property were stopped. [8]\\nIn 1978, the OSG, conformably with the directive embodied in LOI 625, filed with the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal an expropriation complaint against the Doronilla property. Meanwhile, on June 6, 1979, Doronilla issued a Certification,\\n[9]\\ncopy furnished the Agrarian Reform Office, among other agencies, listing seventy-nine (79) \"bona fide planters\" he allegedly permitted to occupy a portion of his land.

Earlier, or on March 15, 1983, J. Amado Araneta, now deceased, acquired ownership of the subject Doronilla property by virtue of court litigation. A little over a week later, he had OCT No. 7924 canceled and secured the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. N-70860 in his name. On July 22, 1987, then President Corazon C. Aquino issued Proclamation No. 131 instituting the\\nComprehensive Agrarian Reform Program\\n(CARP). Thereafter, then DAR Undersecretary Jose C. Medina, in a memorandum of March 10, 1988, ordered the Regional Director of DAR Region IV to proceed with the OLT coverage and final survey of the Doronilla property. [12]\\nRepublic Act No. (RA) 6657, otherwise known as the\\nComprehensive Agrarian Reform Law\\n(CARL)\\n[13]\\nof 1988, was then enacted, and took effect on June 15, 1988. On July 27, 1989, Jorge L. Araneta, as heir of J. Amado Araneta and administrator of his estate, wrote the DAR Secretary requesting approval, for reasons stated in the covering letter, of the conversion of Lot 23 from agricultural to commercial, industrial and other non-agricultural uses. [14]\\nAppended to the letter were maps, location clearance and other relevant documents. Through Jorge L. Araneta, respondent Estate of J. Amado Araneta (Araneta or Araneta Estate) would, however, reiterate the conversion request owing to what it viewed as DAR\\'s inaction on said request.

It claimed that the CARL does not cover the said property, being part of the LS Townsite reservation, apart from being mountainous, with a slope of more than 70 degrees and containing commercial quantities of marble deposit. The Araneta Estate followed its protest letter with two (2) more letters dated June 20, 1990 and May 28, 1991, in which it reiterated its request for conversion, citing, for the purpose, Department of Justice (DOJ) Opinion No. 181, Series of 1990.

On February 26, 1992, Land Bank notified Araneta of its entitlement, upon its compliance with certain requirements, of the amount of PhP 3,324,412.05, representing just compensation for its covered parcels of land.

Immediately prior to the promulgation of PD 27 in October 1972, the 1,645-hectare Doronilla property, or a large portion of it, was indisputably agricultural, some parts devoted to rice and/or corn production tilled by Doronilla\\'s tenants. Doronilla, in fact, provided concerned government agencies with a list of seventy-nine (79)\\n[30]\\nnames he considered\\nbona fide\\n\"planters\" of his land. These planters, who may reasonably be considered tenant-farmers, had purposely, so it seems, organized themselves into\\nSamahang Nayon\\n(s) so that the DAR could start processing their applications under the PD 27 OLT program. CLTs were eventually generated covering 73 hectares, with about 75 CLTs actually distributed to the tenant-beneficiaries. However, upon the issuance of Proclamation 1637, \"all activities related to the OLT were stopped.\" [31]\\nThe discontinuance of the OLT processing was obviously DAR\\'s way of acknowledging the implication of the townsite proclamation on the agricultural classification of the Doronilla property. It ought to be emphasized, as a general proposition, however, that the former agricultural lands of Doronilla--situated as they were within areas duly set aside for townsite purposes, by virtue particularly of Proclamation 1637--were converted for residential use. By the terms of\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n,\\nthey would be exempt from land reform and, by necessarily corollary, beyond DAR\\'s or DARAB\\'s jurisdictional reach. Excerpts from\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n:\\nWe now determine whether such lands are covered by the CARL. Section 4 of R.A. 6657 provides that the CARL shall \"cover, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity produced, all public and private agricultural lands.\" As to what constitutes \"agricultural land,\" it is referred to as \"land devoted to agricultural activity as defined in this Act and\\nnot classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land\\n.\" The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission confirm this limitation. \"Agricultural lands\" are only those lands which are \"arable and suitable agricultural lands\" and \"\\ndo not include commercial, industrial and residential lands\\n.\"', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 663564, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 663564, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (17, 1, 'G.R.

Guided by the foregoing doctrinal pronouncement, the key date to reckon, as a preliminary matter, is the precise time when Doronilla\\'s Lot 23, now Araneta\\'s property, ceased to be agricultural. This is the same crucial cut-off date for considering the existence of \"private rights\" of farmers, if any, to the property in question. This, in turn, means the date when Proclamation 1637 establishing LS Townsite was issued: April 18, 1977. From then on, the entire Lot 23 was, for all intents and purposes, considered residential, exempted ordinarily from land reform, albeit parts of the lot may still be actually suitable for agricultural purposes. Both the Natalia lands, as determined in\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n, and the Doronilla property are situated within the same area covered by Proclamation 1637; thus, the principles regarding the classification of the land within the Townsite stated in\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\napply\\nmutatis mutandis\\nto the instant case. Applicability of PD 27, RA 6657\\nand Proclamation 1637 to the Doronilla Estate\\nFrom the standpoint of agrarian reform, PD 27, being in context the earliest issuance, governed at the start the disposition of the rice-and-corn land portions of the Doronilla property.

And true enough, the DAR began processing land transfers through the OLT program under PD 27 and thereafter issued the corresponding CLTs. However, when Proclamation 1637 went into effect, DAR discontinued with the OLT processing. The tenants of Doronilla during that time desisted from questioning the halt in the issuance of the CLTs. It is fairly evident that DAR noted the effect of the issuance of Proclamation 1637 on the subject land and decided not to pursue its original operation, recognizing the change of classification of the property from agricultural to residential. When it took effect on June 15, 1988, RA 6657 became the prevailing agrarian reform law. This is not to say, however, that its coming into effect necessarily impeded the operation of PD 27, which, to repeat, covers only rice and corn land. Far from it, for RA 6657, which identifies \"rice and corn land\" under PD 27 as among the properties the DAR shall acquire and distribute to the landless,\\n[33]\\nno less provides that PD 27 shall be of suppletory application.

[35]\\nAt the time of the effectivity of RA 6657 on June 15, 1998, the process of agrarian reform on the Doronilla property was, however, to reiterate, far from complete. In fact, the DAR sent out a Notice of Acquisition to Araneta only on December 12, 1989, after the lapse of around 12 years following its discontinuance of all activities incident to the OLT. Proclamation 1637, a martial law and legislative-powers issuance, partakes the nature of a law. In\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n, the Court in fact considered and categorically declared Proclamation 1637 a special law, since it referred specifically to the LS Townsite Reservation.

In light of the foregoing legal framework, the question that comes to the fore is whether or not the OLT coverage of the Doronilla property after June 15, 1988, ordered by DAR pursuant to the provisions of PD 27 and RA 6657, was still valid, given the classificatory effect of the townsite proclamation.', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 675995, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 675995, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (20, 1, 'G.R.

To restate a basic postulate, the provisions of RA 6657 apply only to agricultural lands under which category the Doronilla property, during the period material, no longer falls, having been effectively classified as residential by force of Proclamation 1637. It ceased, following\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n, to be agricultural land upon approval of its inclusion in the LS Townsite Reservation pursuant to the said reclassifying presidential issuance. In this regard, the Court cites with approval the following excerpts from the appealed CA decision:\\nThe above [\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n] ruling was reiterated in\\nNational Housing Authority vs. Allarde\\nwhere the Supreme Court held that lands reserved for, converted to, non-agricultural uses by government agencies other than the [DAR], prior to the effectivity of [RA] 6657 x x x are not considered and treated as agricultural lands and therefore, outside the ambit of said law\\n.

The Court has, to be sure, taken stock of the fact that PD 27 ordains the emancipation of tenants and \"deems\" them owners of the rice and corn lands they till as of October 21, 1972. The following provisions of the decree have concretized this emancipation and ownership policy:\\nThis [decree] shall apply to tenant farmers of private agricultural lands primarily devoted to rice and corn under a system of sharecrop or lease-tenancy, whether classified as landed estate or not;\\nThe tenant farmer x x x\\nshall be deemed owner\\nof a portion constituting a family-size farm of five (5) hectares if not irrigated and three (3) hectares if irrigated. (Emphasis added.) Complementing PD 27 is EO 228, Series of 1987, Sec. 1 of which states, \"All qualified farmer beneficiaries are now\\ndeemed full owners\\nas of October 21, 1972 of the land they acquired by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 27.\" (Emphasis supplied.) Petitioners DAR, Land Bank and Duran, et al. uniformly maintain that the PD 27 tenant-beneficiaries have acquired \"vested rights\" over the lands they tilled as of October 21, 1972 when the decree took effect. Pursuing this point, they argue that, as of that date, the farmer-beneficiaries were \"deemed owners\" of what was to be Araneta\\'s property, and the issuance of Proclamation 1637 did not alter the legal situation. The CA, however, was of a different mind, predicating its stance on the following:\\nSince actual title remained with the landowner Alfonso Doronilla at the time Presidential Proclamation No. 1637 was issued in 1977, it follows that\\nit is the \"private rights\" of such owner which are contemplated by the exemption declared in said proclamation\\n.', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 684429, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 684429, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (22, 1, 'G.R.

Definitely, the proviso \"subject to private rights\" could not refer to the farmer-tenants the process of land reform having just been commenced with the filing of their application with the DAR. The conclusion finds support in a similar proclamation covering the Baguio Townsite Reservation. Our Supreme Court in a case involving an application for registration of lots situated within the Baguio Townsite Reservation cited the decision dated November 13, 1922 of the Land Registration Court in Civil Reservation No. 1, GLRO Record No. 211, which held that all lands within the Baguio Townsite are public land with the exception of (1) lands reserved for specific public uses and (2)\\nlands claimed and adjudicated as private property\\n. It is therefore in that sense that the term \"private rights\" under the subject proviso in Presidential Proclamation No. 1637 must be understood. [38]\\nx x x (Emphasis added.) In fine, the CA held that the \"private rights\" referred to in the proclamation pertained to the rights of the registered owner of the property in question, meaning Doronilla or Araneta, as the case may be. The Court cannot lend full concurrence to the above holding of the appellate court and the consequent wholesale nullification of the awards made by the DARAB. The facts show that several farmer-beneficiaries received 75 CLTs prior to the issuance of Proclamation 1637 on June 21, 1974. The 75 CLTs seemingly represent the first batch of certificates of\\nbona fide\\nplanting rice and corn. These certificates were processed pursuant to the OLT program under PD 27.

It bears to stress, however, that the mere issuance of the CLT does not vest on the recipient-farmer-tenant ownership of the lot described in it. At best, the certificate, in the phraseology of\\nVinzons-Magana v. Estrella\\n,\\n[39]\\n\"merely evidences the government\\'s recognition of the grantee as the party qualified to avail of the statutory mechanisms for the acquisition of ownership of the land [tilled] by him as provided under [PD] 27.\" The clause \"\\nnow deemed full owners as of October 21, 1972\\n\" could not be pure rhetoric, without any beneficial effect whatsoever descending on the actual tillers of rice and/or corn lands, as the appealed decision seems to convey. To Us, the clause in context means that, with respect to the parcel of agricultural land covered by PD 27 and which is under his or her tillage, the farmer-beneficiary\\nipso facto\\nacquires, by weight of that decree, ownership rights over it. That ownership right may perhaps not be irrevocable and permanent, nay vested, until the tenant-farmer shall have complied with the amortization payments on the cost of the land and other requirements exacted in the circular promulgated to implement PD 27. Vinzons-Magana\\nholds:\\nThis Court has therefore clarified that it is only compliance with the prescribed conditions which entitled the farmer/grantee to an emancipation patent by which he acquires the vested right of absolute ownership in the landholding--a right which has become fixed and established and is no longer open to doubt and controversy.

After all, the former landowners, by force of PD 27, is already divested of their ownership of the covered lot, their right to payment of just compensation or of the un-amortized portion payable by Land Bank\\n[41]\\nbeing assured under EO 228 and RA 6657. If only to stress, while the PD 27 tenant-farmers are considered the owners by virtue of that decree, they cannot yet exercise all the attributes inherent in ownership, such as selling the lot, because, with respect to the government represented by DAR and LBP, they have in the meantime only inchoate rights in the lot--the being \"amortizing owners.\" This is because they must still pay all the amortizations over the lot to Land Bank before an EP is issued to them. Then and only then do they acquire, in the phraseology of\\nVinzons-Magana\\n, \"the vested right of absolute ownership in the landholding.\" This brings us to the question, to whom does \"private rights\" referred to in Proclamation 1637 pertain? Absent any agrarian relationship involving the tract of lands covered by the proclamation, We can categorically state that the reference is to the private rights of the registered lot owner, in this case Doronilla and subsequently, Araneta. But then the reality on the ground was that the Araneta property or at least a portion was placed under OLT pursuant to PD 27 and subject to compulsory acquisition by DAR prior to the issuance of Proclamation 1637 on June 21, 1974, and 75 CLTs were also issued to the farmer-beneficiaries.', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 697687, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 697687, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (25, 1, 'G.R.

Stated a bit differently, before Proclamation 1637 came to be, there were already PD 27 tenant-farmers in said property. In a very real sense, the \"private rights\" belong to these tenant-farmers. Since the said farmer-beneficiaries were\\ndeemed owners\\nof the agricultural land awarded to them as of October 21, 1972 under PD 27 and subsequently deemed\\nfull owners\\nunder EO 228, the logical conclusion is clear and simple: the township reservation established under Proclamation 1637 must yield and recognize the \"deemed ownership rights\" bestowed on the farmer-beneficiaries under PD 27. Another way of looking at the situation is that these farmer-beneficiaries are subrogated in the place of Doronilla and eventual transferee Araneta. To Us, the private rights referred to in Proclamation 1637 means those of the farmer-beneficiaries who were issued the 75 CLTs. As to them, farm lots are EXCLUDED from the coverage of Proclamation 1637 and are governed by PD 27 and subsequently RA 6657.

Obviously, they are not rice/corn land tenant-farmers contemplated in PD 27. They do not possess the rights flowing from the phrase \"deemed owner as of October 21, 1972.\" In this regard, the Court notes only too distinctly that Doronilla no less only named some 79 individuals as coming close to being legitimate PD 27 tenant-farmers of Lot 23.', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 701029, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 701029, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (26, 1, 'G.R.

As argued, it is basic that, in the hierarchy of issuances, a law has greater weight than and takes precedence over a mere administrative issuance. Petitioners' contention may be accorded some measure of plausibility, except for the fact that it ignores a basic legal principle: that the power to classify or reclassify lands is essentially an executive prerogative,\\n[43]\\nalbeit local government units, thru zoning ordinances, may, subject to certain conditions, very well effect reclassification of land use within their respective territorial jurisdiction.

So the intervenors, with the exception of the 79 tenant-beneficiaries who were granted CLTs, failed to acquire private rights of ownership under PD 27 before the effective conversion of the Doronilla property to non-agricultural uses. Hence, the Doronilla property, being outside of CARP coverage, is also beyond DARAB\\'s jurisdiction. The OSG\\'s withdrawal of the expropriation suit on September 9, 1987 did not, as Land Bank posits, automatically restore the Doronilla property to its original classification nor did it grant DAR or DARAB the power or jurisdiction to order the compulsory acquisition of the property and to place it under CARP. And, as the CA aptly noted, the DOJ Secretary, through Opinion No. 181,\\n[48]\\neven advised the DAR Secretary that lands covered by Proclamation 1637, having been reserved for townsite purposes, are not deemed\\n\"agricultural lands\" within the meaning and intent of Sec. 3(c) of RA 6657 and, hence, outside the coverage of CARL\\n. [49]\\nThe Secretary of Justice further stated that RA 6657 did not supersede or repeal Proclamations 1283 and 1637 and they remain operative until now; their being townsite reservations still remain valid and subsisting. To clarify, a DOJ opinion carries only a persuasive weight upon the courts. However since this Court, in\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\n, cited with approval DOJ Opinion No. 181, such citation carries weight and importance as jurisprudence. Be that as it may, We recognize and apply the principles found in\\nNatalia Realty, Inc.\\nregarding the character of the Doronilla property being converted to a townsite and, thus, non-agricultural in character. Worth mentioning at this juncture is the fact that DAR itself issued administrative circulars governing lands exempted from CARP. For instance, Administrative No. (AO) 3, Series of 1996, declares in its policy statement what categories of lands are outside CARP coverage and unequivocally states that properties not covered by CARP shall be reconveyed to the original transferors or owners.', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 722853, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 722853, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (31, 1, 'G.R.

With Respect to Petitioners-Intervenors Duran, et al. In their petition for intervention filed before Us on December 17, 2009, Duran, et al. claim that Atty. Lara, the counsel who won their case before the DARAB, passed away on March 6, 1995. [52]\\nThey bemoan the fact that due to his death, which was unbeknownst to them at that time, they were not able to receive a copy of, thus are not bound by, the CA Decision dated September 19, 2003.

In its Comment (with motion to exclude) on intervenors\\' petition for review, Araneta stated the observation that if a handling lawyer dies, it is the that lawyer\\'s client who is in the better position to know about the former\\'s death, not his adversary or the court. Assuming that court notices and pleadings continued to be sent and delivered to Atty. Lara even after his death, at his given address, the comment added, it was intervenors\\' fault.

Exclusion is also sought on the ground that the petition includes individuals who are long dead and parties who are not parties below. We resolve to deny due course to the plea for intervention of Duran, et al. As the records would show, the DARAB promulgated its Decision on February 7, 2001 or six (6) years\\nafter\\nAtty. Lara died. Yet, intervening petitioners opted to make an issue only with respect about their inability, due to Atty. Lara\\'s death, to receive the adverse CA Decision, but curiously not about the DARAB judgment favorable to them. Noticeably, in the instant petition, they only focused on questioning what they termed as the \"malicious\" failure of the Estate of Araneta to individually inform them of the filing of its petition for review with the CA. Nowhere can it be gleaned that they are questioning the failure of the CA and the DARAB to send copies of their respective decisions to them. Thus, the Court is at a loss to understand how Duran, et al. can insinuate malice on the part of the Estate of Araneta\\'s for its alleged failure to provide them with a copy of the CA decision and yet not have any problem with respect to the DARAB decision which they also failed to personally receive due to their counsel\\'s demise. While the fault clearly lies with Duran, et al. themselves, they found it convenient to point fingers. To be sure, they were remiss in their duty of coordinating with their counsel on the progress of their pending case. The constant communication link needed to be established between diligent clients and their attorney did not obtain in this case. It is not surprising, therefore, that Duran and his group only filed their instant petition 14 years after the death of their counsel, Atty. Lara.', None, None, datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 735428, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai')), datetime.datetime(2025, 11, 29, 19, 40, 18, 735428, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))), (34, 1, 'G.R.

[56]\\nEquity serves the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights. [57]\\nDuran, et al., as are expected of prudent men concerned with their ordinary affairs, should have had periodically touched base at least to be apprised with the status of their case.

As Araneta aptly suggested in its Comment on the petition for review-in-intervention, it is Duran, et al., as clients, not the court or their adversary, who are in a better position or at least expected to know about their lawyer's death due to the nature of a client-lawyer relationship. And knowing, fair play demands that the client accordingly advises the court and the adverse party about the fact of death. It is not for the appellate court or respondent Araneta to inquire why service of court processes or pleadings seemingly remained unacted by Atty. De Lara and/or his clients. The long inaction of Duran, et al. to assert their rights over the subject case should be brought to bear against them. Thus, We held in\\nEsmaquel v.

There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes laches or staleness of demand; each case is to be determined according to its particular circumstances, with the question of laches addressed to the sound discretion of the court. Because laches is an equitable doctrine, its application is controlled by equitable considerations and should not be used to defeat justice or to perpetuate fraud or injustice. There can be little quibble about Duran, et al. being guilty of laches. They failed and neglected to keep track of their case with their lawyer for 14 long years. As discussed above, Atty. Lara died even prior to the promulgation of the DARAB Decision. Even then, they failed to notify the DARAB and the other parties of the case regarding the demise of Atty. Lara and even a change of counsel. It certainly strains credulity to think that literally no one, among those constituting the petitioning-intervenors, had the characteristic good sense of following up the case with their legal counsel. Only now, 14 years after, did some think of fighting for the right they slept on. Thus, as to them, the CA Decision is deemed final and executory based on the principle of laches. Agrarian reform finds context in social justice in tandem with the police power of the State. But social justice itself is not merely granted to the marginalized and\\xa0 the underprivileged.
